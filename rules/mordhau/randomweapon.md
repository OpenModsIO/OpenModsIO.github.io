# Welcome to Random Weapon [by OpenIO]

This server was put together (and is managed) by Bubble; which OpenIO is immensely grateful for.

## OpenIO
OpenIO (or, affectionately, "OiO") is about helping our community to become happier, healthier, wealthier and more connected - through collaboration on gaming, coding and more.

It's about making those online avatars you meet in games, into genuine friends and fostering real connections.

So if you read nothing else, the capital rule, and essentially only rule: **Do no harm**. That's all you need to read. But do read on if interested.

## Discord
Our Discord is predominantly made up of a group of people who want to make some of the people they meet online into actual friends; so keep that culture and vibe in mind.
TBC - DM Bubble or an Admin to appeal

## Rules
 * The Golden Rule: Do no harm
 * Use common sense - no racism, hatespeech. Don't abuse the TV room - memes are okay but no noise spam or inappropriate content

Having trouble figuring out if what you're about to say is doing harm? Is it pretty contentious? Maybe just don't say it!

If you're looking to engage genuinely on political or contentious issues, we have a space in our Discord for that. If you don't reach for emotive arguments or hearsay then you'll likely end up having a good chat. Join us!

## Admins
Admins are folk who have the Contributor role in Discord. The Discord currently has a hierarchy of Support (like admins), Contributor (people who help the Discord) and Members.

To obtain Admin, demonstrate the values of OpenIO, or go out of your way to help (we have a laundry list of tasks!). Ask yourself as well why you want admin and reach out to the server owner (Bubble) or a Support role in Discord to apply.
