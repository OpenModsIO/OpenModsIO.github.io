## Eco (ECOre Round 21) Docs

Welcome! Kudos for reading the docs! First off, make sure you join our (Discord)[https://discord.gg/QtyRqMce3j] to stay in the loop for any downtime/outages, make some new friends :), learn to code or vote on future features.

If you're new to ECOre, don't worry, we won't bore you. We've kept this as brief as possible so you can get back to playing. The most important thing for us is to make a server which is both challenging and fun, introducing novel aspects to keep you happy.

ECOre servers are slightly more difficult than regular servers.

Many of our QoL changes exist to make pollution/environmental harm more alluring - for example, animals are easier to hunt, causing a higher risk of extinction!

### The Important Stuff:
- Custom-designed world map! This is a one-of-a-kind feature and we invite players to help generate future maps (you can use tools like (EcoMapMaker by MinnChops)[https://ecomapmaker.app]
- Ores Everywhere: Reduced ores in desert. Iron ore in all biomes. Reduced gold; but in all biomes. Copper plentiful too.
- More realistic Fuel consumption, to drive Fuel companies to exist
- Crafting time increase to encourage resource consumption in building large factories
- Slower animals to encourage hunting
- No natural tree regrowth/spread - you need to plant seeds manually!
- plus more
