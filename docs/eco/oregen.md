### Grassland Biome Configuration Overview:

#### Surface Composition:
  - Primarily composed of Dirt Blocks at the surface.
  - Rocky Soil Block found within a 200-unit depth range, with a 5% occurrence chance.

#### Subsurface Layers:
  - Clay Blocks are present between depths of 2 to 6 units with a 100% chance of occurrence.
  - Limestone Blocks appear in a depth range of 2 to 15 units, accompanied by Crushed Limestone near the surface (0-1 unit depth).

#### Sandstone and Associated Ores:
  - Sandstone Blocks are common up to 15 units deep. Crushed Sandstone is also found near the surface.
  - Crushed Iron Ore is present within the sandstone layer (0-5 unit depth) but is relatively rare (10% chance).

#### Deep Sandstone and Limestone Layers:
  - Further down, Sandstone Blocks appear between 55 to 60 units deep.
  - Limestone Blocks and Coal Blocks are found between 10 to 20 units and 18 to 22 units deep, respectively.
  - A significant Coal Block deposit (5000-8000 blocks) occurs at this depth but is very rare (0.01% chance).
  - Iron Ore Blocks are located deeper between 45 to 60 units, in large deposits (1000-10000 blocks) but are very rare (0.005% chance).

#### Granite and Gneiss Layers:
  - Granite Blocks are found between 60 to 80 units deep, with Crushed Granite present.
  - Gneiss Blocks appear at the greatest depths (70-100 units), without significant submodules.

Key Takeaways for Players:

- Surface Exploration: Focus on Dirt and Rocky Soil. Clay and Limestone are easily accessible.
- Mining Strategy: For Iron Ore, target Sandstone areas; for Coal, explore deeper layers but be prepared for rarity.
- Rare Finds: Gold Ore in Granite zones is extremely rare, but keep an eye out.
- Deep Excavations: Gneiss appears at great depths, though with no associated resources in this biome.
